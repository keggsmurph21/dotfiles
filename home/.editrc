# On Ubuntu, MySQL is bundled with libedit instead of libreadline.  This
# means that it has totally different keybindings.  Luckily, we can define
# our own keybindings to mimic libreadline ...

bind "^W" ed-delete-prev-word
bind "^U" vi-kill-line-prev
bind "^R" em-inc-search-prev
bind "^5D" vi-prev-word  # LeftArrow
bind "^5C" vi-next-word  # RightArrow

# Ideally, we would bind this to '^C', but that doesn't seem to work for
# me (not sure why ...) even with '--sigint-ignore'.
bind "^X" ed-start-over
